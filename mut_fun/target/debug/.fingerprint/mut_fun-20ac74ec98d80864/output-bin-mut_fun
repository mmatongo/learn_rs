{"message":"ambiguous associated type","code":{"code":"E0223","explanation":"An attempt was made to retrieve an associated type, but the type was ambiguous.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0223\ntrait MyTrait {type X; }\n\nfn main() {\n    let foo: MyTrait::X;\n}\n```\n\nThe problem here is that we're attempting to take the type of X from MyTrait.\nUnfortunately, the type of X is not defined, because it's only made concrete in\nimplementations of the trait. A working version of this code might look like:\n\n```\ntrait MyTrait {type X; }\nstruct MyStruct;\n\nimpl MyTrait for MyStruct {\n    type X = u32;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let foo: <MyStruct as MyTrait>::X;\n}\n```\n\nThis syntax specifies that we want the X type from MyTrait, as made concrete in\nMyStruct. The reason that we cannot simply use `MyStruct::X` is that MyStruct\nmight implement two different traits with identically-named associated types.\nThis syntax allows disambiguation between the two.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":21,"byte_end":32,"line_start":1,"line_end":1,"column_start":22,"column_end":33,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"fn modifiable(name: &String::new) -> String {","highlight_start":22,"highlight_end":33}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"use fully-qualified syntax","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":21,"byte_end":32,"line_start":1,"line_end":1,"column_start":22,"column_end":33,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"fn modifiable(name: &String::new) -> String {","highlight_start":22,"highlight_end":33}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"<String as Trait>::new","suggestion_applicability":"HasPlaceholders","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0223]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: ambiguous associated type\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0msrc/main.rs:1:22\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m1\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0mfn modifiable(name: &String::new) -> String {\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m  \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m                     \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mhelp: use fully-qualified syntax: `<String as Trait>::new`\u001b[0m\n\n"}
